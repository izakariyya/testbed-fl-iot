<ins>**Resource Efficient Federated Deep Learning for IoT Security Monitoring**</ins>

The aim of this project is to deploy a resource-efficient federated deep learning algorithm that can enhance security solutions in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. 
To achieve this objective, a realistic testbed has been developed using GB-BXBT-2807 devices.
